# Movie Recommendation Application with Server-Side Rendering

Welcome to the ultimate movie recommendation application challenge! In this challenge, you'll build an application that allows users to discover and explore movies with the added benefit of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO. You'll utilize The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data and incorporate it into your application. You'll implement this using Next.js, incorporating Material or Tailwind UI for the user interface and TypeScript for type safety.

## Requirements

To complete this challenge, your application should meet the following requirements:

1. **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for movies by title, genre, or any other relevant criteria.

2. **Display Movie Details**: Display detailed information about the selected movie, including its title, release date, genres, synopsis, and rating.

3. **Display Similar Movies**: Show a list of similar movies based on the selected movie's genre or other relevant attributes.

4. **Use React Router**: Utilize Next.js's routing system to create different pages for home, search results, movie details, etc.

5. **Use React Redux Toolkit**: Manage the application's state using React Redux Toolkit, including storing the current movie, search results, and other relevant data.

6. **Use Axios for API Calls**: Utilize Axios to make API calls to The Movie Database (TMDb) API to retrieve movie data.

7. **Implement Material or Tailwind UI**: Create a visually appealing user interface using Material or Tailwind UI components to display movie information in a clear and concise way.

8. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement SSR to pre-render pages on the server for improved performance and SEO.

## Bonus Features

As a bonus, you can implement the following features:

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and save favorite movies or create watchlists.

2. **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.

3. **Movie Recommendations**: Incorporate a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on the user's watch history or preferences.

4. **Integration with External APIs**: Integrate additional APIs, such as movie trailers from YouTube or reviews from IMDb, to enhance the user experience.

5. **Localization**: Implement localization to support multiple languages for the application interface.

6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
